##Writing a Book on Piwik
I have written a lot of blog posts up to now and a lot of articles. And when I was about 16, I started a novel after seeing "This Boy's Life" which was trashed before I finished the first chapter.

So when Packt asked me if I wanted to write a book on Piwik Open Source Analytics, I said hell yeah. 250 pages is a lot of pages. And a lot of code. It was the code part that I didn't count on being as hard as it was. Not that it was hard, but coming up with examples that don't look like toy code is kind of a bitch.
